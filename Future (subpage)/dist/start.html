		    Hello again!
		  </h1>
		  <p> In the 1990’s Tim Berners-Lee theorized web 3.0 as having two categories:
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  <ul>
			<li id="strong">Decentralization</li>
				<ul>
				<li>“No permission is needed from a central authority to post anything on the web, there is no central controlling node, and so no single point of failure...and no ‘kill switch’! This also implies freedom from indiscriminate censorship and surveillance.”</li>
				</ul> 
			<br>
			<li id="strong">Bottom-up design</li>
			<ul>
				<li>“Instead of code being written and controlled by a small group of experts, it was developed in full view of everyone, encouraging maximum participation and experimentation.”</li>
				</ul> 
		  </ul> 
		  <br>
		  In this spirit of decentralization, openness, and greater user utility, it’s now your turn to customize your experience!
		  <br>
		  <br>
		  You may have noticed that there arrows and a button on the bottom right of your screen. You can use the arrows to scale the text to your liking. Then use the colour button to match to your personal feelings today!

			<h1>As of now:</h1>
			<p>
				Web 3.0 has the potential to be as disruptive and represent as big a paradigm shift as Web 2.0 did.
				<br>
				<br>
				Web 3.0 as it stands is more of a concept at this point in time. While some may argue we already started this phase of the web, we are more in an beta release of it. We currently have remnants of technologies that represent the ideals of this next generation of web. But they are nothing but prototypes and concepts. At best it’s more of a “work in progress”.
				<br>
				<br>				
				Otherwise known as the “Semantic web”, it’s a web where the concept of website or webpage disappears, where data isn’t owned but instead shared, where services show different views for the same web or the same data. Those services can be applications (like browsers, virtual worlds or anything else), devices or other, and have to be focused on context and personalization, and both will be reached by using vertical search.

			<br>
			<br>

		</div>

		<div class="statement">
			<h1>What is the Semantic web?</h1>
			<p>
				The Semantic Web is a collaborative movement led by international standards body the World Wide Web Consortium. According to the W3C: “The Semantic Web provides a common framework that allows data to be shared and reused across application, enterprise, and community boundaries “
				<br>
				<br>
				The main purpose of the Semantic Web is driving the evolution of the current Web by enabling users to find, share and combine information more easily. The Semantic Web, as originally envisioned, is a system that enables machines to “understand” and respond to complex human requests based on their meaning. Such an “understanding” requires that the relevant information sources be semantically structured.
				<br>
				<br>
				<ul>
					<li id="strong">Is Web 3.0 the Same as the Semantic Web?</li>
				</ul>			
				Web 3.0 goes well beyond the Semantic Web envisioned by web pioneer Tim Berners-Lee in 2001. Though Web 3.0 uses technologies based on Semantic Web concepts and natural language processing to make user interaction more intuitive, it also has other features, such as widespread use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, and trustless or permissionless systems, such as blockchain and peer-to-peer networks.

			<h1>Potential and Pitfalls of Web 3.0</h1>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li style="list-style-type:circle;" id="indent-add">Web 3.0 has the potential to provide users with far greater utility, going well beyond the social media, streaming, and online shopping that comprise the majority of Web 2.0 applications consumers use. Capabilities like Semantic Web, AI, and machine learning, which are at the core of Web 3.0, have the potential to greatly increase application in new areas and vastly improve user interaction.</li>
					<br>
					<li style="list-style-type:circle;" id="indent-add">Core features of Web 3.0, such as decentralization and permissionless systems, will also give users much greater control over their personal data. This may help limit the practice of data extraction—which refers to information collected from web users without their consent or compensation—and curb the network effects that have enabled the technology giants to become near-monopolies through exploitative advertising and marketing practices.</li>
					<br>
					<li style="list-style-type:circle;" id="indent-add">However, decentralization also brings with it significant legal and regulatory risks. Cybercrime, hate speech, and misinformation are already difficult to police and will become even more so in a decentralized structure because of the lack of central control. A decentralized web would also make regulation and enforcement very difficult; for example, which country’s laws would apply to a specific website whose content is hosted in numerous nations globally?</li>

		<div class="statement">
			<h1>Other potential challenges</h1>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li style="list-style-type:circle;" id="indent-add">Vastness: The World Wide Web contains many billions of pages. Redundancy in Data may occur which has not yet been able to eliminate all semantically duplicated terms.</li>
					<br>
					<li style="list-style-type:circle;" id="indent-add">Vagueness: This arises from the vagueness of user queries, of concepts represented by content providers, of matching query terms to provider terms and of trying to combine different knowledge bases with overlapping but subtly different concepts.</li>
					<br>
					<li style="list-style-type:circle;" id="indent-add">Inconsistency: These are logical contradictions which will inevitably arise during the development of large ontologies, and when ontologies from separate sources are combined.</li>
					<br>
					<li style="list-style-type:circle;" id="indent-add">Deceit: This is when the producer of the information is intentionally misleading the consumer of the information.</li>

			<h1>How would web 3.0 facilitate the lives of users?</h1>
			<p>
				As an example, if you are making plans for a vacation and are on a budget, you currently would have to spend hours looking for flights, accommodation, and car rentals, trawling through numerous websites and comparing prices. With Web 3.0, intelligent search engines or bots will be able to collate all this information and generate tailored recommendations based on your profile and preferences, saving you hours of work.

			<h1>The future is soon:</h1>
			<p>
				In recent months prototypes of this technology has become increasingly popular. It’s taken form though AI bots called Chat GDP and open AI, and it’s hailed as being the next new thing.
				<br>
				<br>
				So much so as it’s starting to be invested into by the big tech giants of now, and integrated into applications as of a few weeks ago. See below some recent examples of this integration into commonly used products.
