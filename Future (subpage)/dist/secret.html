        <h1>The future is soon...</h1>
        <p>
            Free yourself from expectations, because nothing will prepare you for what the future has in store for us.

            What we see now is nothing more than just a glimpse into it’s endless void. Prepare yourself by opening yourself up to new life-altering changes.

            Embrace it before it absorbs your sanity.

            If you don’t, you may become part of “it”.

            Some speculate about a web 4.0, where Ultra-Intelligent AI rules all. 

            Interaction between humans and machines in symbiosis was motive behind of the symbiotic web. Powerful as human brain, progress in the development of telecommunications, advancement on nanotechnology in the world and controlled interfaces using web 4.0. In simple words, machines would be clever on reading the contents of the web, and react in the form of executing and deciding what to execute first to load the websites fast with superior quality and performance and build more commanding interfaces. 

            Web 4.0 will be read write concurrency web. It ensures global transparency, governance, distribution, participation, collaboration into key communities such as industry, political, social and other communities. WebOS will be such as a middleware in which will start functioning like an operating system. WebOS will be parallel to the human brain and implies a massive web of highly intelligent interactions.
